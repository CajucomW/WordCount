## A challenge from KickStart Coding Bootcamp!!!

# Write an application that reads in a text file
# (see the book text file found in the 4th activity), and generates a word
# count for each word it encounters.

# Full Requirements:
# - Sort the output either alphabetically, or by count.
# - Only print the top X number, e.g. top 100.
# - It should ignore case and punctuation.
# - Use string formatting methods to make the output easy to read.
# - The output, for example, might be something like:
#       the 1801
#       and 910
#        to 794
#       ...etc
